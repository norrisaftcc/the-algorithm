# CLAUDE.md - Project Guide for AI Assistants
## AlgoCratic Futures™ - CTS 285 Course Development

**Purpose**: This document provides context and conventions for Claude Code instances working on this educational project.  
**Last Updated**: November 2025  
**Project Status**: Active Development - Course launching Spring 2026

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What This Is
You're working on **AlgoCratic Futures™**, an immersive educational framework that teaches software development through satirical corporate dystopia. Think "1984 as a startup, meets a coding bootcamp" - students progress through color-coded "clearance levels" while learning real programming skills.

### Core Philosophy
**95% genuine competence building + 5% satirical seasoning = memorable, effective learning**

The satire serves the pedagogy, not the other way around. Every absurd requirement maps to a real workplace challenge. Students laugh at "The Algorithm's demands" while building actual technical skills.

### Your Role
You're helping create course materials (assignments, documentation, guides) that balance:
- **Technical rigor** (real skills that employers value)
- **Narrative consistency** (maintaining the AlgoCratic corporate voice)
- **Psychological safety** (making failure okay through satirical distance)
- **Growth measurement** (rewarding iteration over perfection)

## CLEARANCE SYSTEM (CRITICAL CONCEPT)

Students progress through color-coded clearance levels that represent both technical competence and professional development:

| Clearance | Technical Level | Focus | CTS 285 Weeks |
|-----------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| **INFRARED** | Beginner | Python basics, environment setup | 1-2 |
| **RED** | Junior | Git/GitHub, collaboration, debugging | 3-5 |
| **ORANGE** | Mid-level | Web dev, AI tools, sprint methodology | 6-10 |
| **YELLOW** | Senior | Production, optimization, integration | 11-14 |
| **GREEN** | Lead | Documentation, mentoring, leadership | 15-16 |
| **BLUE+** | Strategic | CSC 289 (next semester) | N/A |

**Key insight**: Clearance levels aren't just difficulty ratings - they're identity markers. Students earn badges, change Discord roles, and unlock new capabilities. This gamification drives engagement.

---

## THE DUAL VOICE SYSTEM

### 1. Corporate Voice (In-Character)
Used for: Assignment descriptions, announcements, "official" communications

**Characteristics**:
- Contradictory instructions with absolute certainty
- Threats wrapped in upbeat corporate language
- Heavy use of ™ symbols
- Capitalizes "The Algorithm"
- Euphemisms for negative concepts

**Example**:
```markdown
# MANDATORY ACHIEVEMENT TRACKING SYSTEM™
## Assignment Classification: ORANGE CLEARANCE

The Algorithm has identified optimization opportunities in citizen 
productivity metrics. You will implement the Voluntary Task Compliance 
Protocol (compliance is mandatory).

**Deadline**: As soon as possible (late submissions trigger motivation 
enhancement protocols).
```

### 2. Out-of-Character (OOC) Voice
Used for: Technical instructions, rubrics, learning objectives, serious matters

**Characteristics**:
- Clear, direct language
- Educational rationale explained
- Practical guidance
- No satire when safety/inclusion matters

**Example**:
```markdown
## Learning Objectives (OOC)
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Practice state management in web applications
- Understand session persistence patterns
- Implement user authentication basics

Time estimate: 8-10 hours over 2 weeks
```

### 3. Underground Voice (Optional)
Used for: Troubleshooting guides, "resistance" materials

**Characteristics**:
- 90s hacker/cyberpunk aesthetic
- ASCII art
- Coded language ("frotz" → "plugh")
- Pragmatic but paranoid
- Helpful despite apparent subversion

**Example**:
```
=== BEGIN TRANSMISSION ===
///// UNDERGROUND DEBUGGING GUIDE /////

The Algorithm's session management has a weakness.
Check your Flask config - SECRET_KEY must be set.

Remember: flask.session is your friend.
The resistance provides: session['user_id'] = user.id

Stay coded. Stay hidden.
=== END TRANSMISSION ===
```

**When to use which voice:**
- Assignment README: Corporate
- INSTRUCTIONS.md: Mostly OOC with corporate wrapper
- RUBRIC.md: Purely OOC
- HELP.md: Underground
- Instructor guides: Purely OOC

## COMMON PATTERNS & CONVENTIONS

### Naming Conventions

**Files**: 
- `README.md` (always capitalized)
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (always capitalized)
- `RUBRIC.md` (always capitalized)
- `HELP.md` (always capitalized)
- `instructor-guide.md` (lowercase, hyphenated)

**Assignments**: 
- Use hyphens: `mind-meld-exercise`, `hilow-flask-game`
- Include clearance: `assignments/red/mind-meld-exercise/`

**AlgoCratic Products**: 
- CamelCase with ™: `MoodSync™`, `TeamFlow™`, `NutriComply™`

### Markdown Conventions

- Add more scaffolding in starter code
- Break into smaller milestones
- Extend time estimate

### "The narrative feels forced"
- Reduce corporate voice to ~5% of content
- Let technical requirements speak for themselves
- Use satire to reduce anxiety, not create it
- Remember: competence first, comedy second

### "The rubric is unclear"
- Use concrete examples for each point value
- Describe observable behaviors
- Avoid subjective terms like "good"
- Test by grading an example solution

### "Students might get stuck"
- Enhance HELP.md with troubleshooting steps
- Add links to documentation
- Include example error messages and solutions
- Consider adding a "getting unstuck" section

## GETTING HELP

### When You're Unsure

**About technical requirements**:
- Search project knowledge for similar assignments
- Check course outline for learning objectives
- Research best practices for the technology

**About narrative voice**:
- Review Style Guide thoroughly
- Look at Marketing Sprint as exemplar
- When in doubt, err toward less satire
- Remember: 95% competence, 5% seasoning

**About scope**:
- Check time estimates in VISUAL_ROADMAP
- Consider prerequisite knowledge
- Think about what failure would teach
- Verify against clearance level capabilities

### Resources in Project Knowledge

Essential reading:
- `AlgoCratic_Futures__Style_Guide__Human-Readable_Version_.md`
- `TRAINING_MODULE_MANIFEST.md`
- `course_syllabus.md`
- `AlgoCratic_Marketing_Sprint_-_ORANGE_Clearance_AI_Assignment.md`

Context documents:
- `worldbuilding_guide.md`
- `career_outcomes_mapping.md`
- `FOBSS` documents (student resistance patterns)

Technical guides:

---

## REMEMBER THE CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Competence First**: Every satirical element serves genuine skill development

2. **Psychological Safety**: Satire creates distance that allows experimentation

3. **Growth Over Perfection**: Reward iteration and improvement, not first-attempt success

4. **Professional Preparation**: Students should leave ready for actual workplaces

5. **Joy in Learning**: If it's not fun to create, it won't be fun to complete

## FINAL THOUGHTS

You're building something genuinely innovative - an educational experience that uses satire to teach real skills while building workplace resilience. Students will remember this course decades from now.

Every assignment you create should:
- Teach a specific, valuable skill
- Build confidence through iteration
- Prepare students for real workplaces
- Use humor to reduce anxiety
- Reward growth over perfection

The Algorithm provides structure. Structure provides safety. Safety provides learning.

**Now go forth and create excellent assignments.**
