# F-014 — What `main` actually has, before the breadth pass

**Date:** 2026-07-29 · **Status:** Recorded · **Branch:** `claude/backlog-prioritization-test-selection-b0o1m2`
**Decided in:** [[ADR-016-breadth-first-pass]] ·
**Context:** [[F-006-m4-fixes-and-ready]], [[F-009-fallthrough-warning-claim-is-toolchain-dependent]],
[[F-013-markdown-blocks-are-unversioned-copies]] · **Relates to:** #20, #21, #30

## Why this was measured

A new priority arrived — *humans must be able to open any module and review a representative
example*. Before choosing what to build, the question was what exists. The answer disagreed with
two of the three places that claim to track it.

## 1. Coverage on `main`: one module in nine

| Module | M0 | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authored beats | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **4** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Eight modules hold scaffold only: `_overview.md`, `_mlos.md`, `_assets.md`, and an
`_assess-spec.STUB.md` whose banner reads *"NOT YET AUTHORED — STUB… do not hand this stub to
students."* M4 alone carries `learn.md`, `practice-exit-ticket.md` (+ key), `apply-tutorial.md`,
`assess-lab.md`, and 10 gated `.cpp`.

**4 of 36 LPAA beats exist.** A review meeting held today can only discuss M4.

## 2. M5 is complete and stranded — and its CI has never run

PR #20 (`module/m5-deep`) carries a finished M5: 5 authored Markdown beats, **20 gated `.cpp`**,
`F-007`, and `modules/MODULES.md` — the status table `main` does not otherwise have.

Both review items on the PR thread are **closed**: the `mode: "SPLIT"` ruling (no ADR needed;
`_overview.md` is sufficient authority) and the A-tier trim in `e891fca`. The only thing holding
it open is #21, the M5 cohort round — a *depth* gate.

**The defect:** PR #20's base sha is `c3dbb62`, which **predates the compile gate landing**
(PR #26). Its only check run is `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`. **The `compile-gate` workflow has
never executed against a single M5 file.**

The gate evidence in the PR body is *Apple clang 21.0.0 on macOS*. That is precisely the toolchain
ADR-014 declares non-authoritative, and F-009 exists because that exact gap shipped a
`-Wimplicit-fallthrough` warning inside a module that had been certified Ready. **M5's 20 `.cpp`
files therefore carry an unverified clean-compile claim** — not a known-bad one, an unchecked one,
which is the same category of unknown ADR-014 was written to close.

Merging `main` into `module/m5-deep` makes CI run for the first time and settles it. That is the
first action ADR-016 schedules.

**Settled, same day.** `main` merged in as `07d2408`; CI ran against M5 for the first time.
`g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra` on ubuntu-latest reported **32 files: 31 clean, 0 warned,
0 errored, 1 expected (marked)** — the one expected being M4's `practice-item5-fallthrough.cpp`
asserting its `EXPECT-WARNING` marker. **All 20 `modules/m5/code/*.cpp` are clean.**

The macOS result was right. It is now also *evidence* — which is the whole distinction ADR-014
draws, and the reason this was worth checking rather than assuming. A claim that turns out true
was still unverified while it was unverified.

## 3. Gate counts, measured (not estimated)

Run on this branch, GCC on Linux, 2026-07-29:

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `compile-gate.sh` | **PASSED** — 12 files: 11 clean, 0 warned, 0 errored, 1 expected (`practice-item5-fallthrough.cpp`, marked `EXPECT-WARNING`) |
| `markdown-gate.sh` | **FAILED** — 23 blocks: 0 matched, 0 failed, **23 unmigrated** (#30) |

The 23 break down as `apply-tutorial.md` 8, `learn.md` 8, `practice-exit-ticket.md` 6,
`assess-lab.md` 1 — matching the countdown in #30 exactly.

**Merging M5 will take that number to 45.** Counted directly on `origin/module/m5-deep`: M5 adds
**22 unannotated fences** (`learn.md` 6, `practice-exit-ticket.md` 7, `apply-tutorial.md` 8,
`assess-lab.md` 1; the exit-ticket key has none). Recorded here in advance so the jump reads as
pre-existing debt arriving, **not as a regression introduced by the merge**. #30's scope grows
from 23 to 45; nothing about it becomes newly wrong.

**Confirmed in CI after the merge**, file for file: `GATE FAILED — 45 block(s) are UNMIGRATED,
not defective.` The prediction is recorded above the result on purpose. A number written down
*before* the run is a check on the model of the system; the same number written down after is
only a transcript.

This is also the measurement behind ADR-016's born-compliant rule. Seven more Learn beats authored
the old way would put the count past 100 and turn a tracked debt into an unpayable one.

## 4. The manifest contradicts the module tree

`_tracking/course-manifest-csc134.yaml` is `manifest_version: "0.2"`, `last_updated:
"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"` — six months stale and pre-spine. It is wrong in four ways at once:

- Legacy padded **`M00`–`M08`** numbering, not the spine's `M0`–`M8`.
- **`M04 Decision Structures` is listed `planned`.** M4 is built, cohort-tested, and Ready (F-006).
- It still carries **`M06` (Arrays/Strings)** and **`M07` (File I/O and Structs)** as live modules.
  ADR-011 descoped STL/`std::string`-as-a-topic and File I/O.
- Its rollup (`complete: 14`, `planned: 40`, `percentage: 26`) describes the frozen `assignments/`
  tree, not `modules/` — and ADR-008 made `modules/` canonical.

Its rebuild was deferred on purpose (`_tracking/skeleton-plan.md:108`, downstream of open question
1) and that deferral was reasonable. What is not reasonable is that it reads as authoritative while
being wrong. **Mitigation applied now: a staleness banner naming `modules/MODULES.md` as the real
index.** The rebuild stays deferred until the breadth pass completes.

## 5. A Ready module was telling readers it had not been authored

Found while checking what a reviewer actually sees on opening a module.

`modules/m4/_assess-spec.STUB.md` — inside M4, **certified Ready** (F-006), sitting
next to a shipped `assess-lab.md` — still opened with:

> **NOT YET AUTHORED — STUB**
> …no acceptance criteria here are complete… **do not hand this stub to students.**

Its body was worse than the banner: the tier ladder was captioned *"not yet filled
with this lab's real requirements,"* the four-column table *"unfilled placeholders,
not this lab's real rubric text,"* and the no-hidden-criteria promise was written in
the future tense — *"applies once this stub is instantiated."* M5 carried the same
text, identically.

**Nothing in the file was false when it was written.** It went stale the moment the
lab landed, and nothing was watching. The module's `_overview.md` *was* updated at
deep-build; the stub beside it was not. So M4 shipped with two files disagreeing
about whether M4 existed, and the wrong one was the one making a direct instruction
to the reader.

This is the same failure class as F-009 and F-013 — **a claim that stopped being
checked**. F-009 was a compiler claim that no longer held; F-013 was a listing no
longer matching its source; this is a status banner no longer matching its module.
It survived a deep build, a cohort round, and a Ready certification, because every
one of those looked at the lab and none looked at the file next to it.

**Ruled and applied:** a `_assess-spec.STUB.md` whose lab is authored becomes the
**build record** — kept for the acceptance criteria and contract the lab was written
against, never handed to a student, and losing to `assess-lab.md` in any
disagreement. The empty rubric cells stay empty rather than being back-filled, so
the file cannot drift into a second competing rubric. Banners retargeted on M4 and
M5; the convention is now stated in `modules/MODULES.md` so every module that
reaches Built inherits it.

The `.STUB` filename is kept deliberately — renaming across nine modules would
break links for a cosmetic win, and the banner is the authority on status, not the
name. Recorded here so the mismatch reads as a decision rather than an oversight.

## Disposition

| Item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| 1/9 coverage | Addressed by [[ADR-016-breadth-first-pass]] — a Learn beat in every module |
| M5 stranded in #20 | **Done** — `main` merged in as `07d2408`, CI run, handed back for human merge (ADR-004) |
| M5's unverified compile claim | **Closed, verified** — `compile` job green on GCC in CI; all 20 M5 sources clean |
| 23 → 45 unmigrated blocks | Predicted, then confirmed in CI. Recorded against #30; scope grows, nothing regresses. Born-compliant rule keeps it from growing further |
| Stale manifest | Banner now; rebuild after the breadth pass |
| M4/M5 stubs claiming "NOT YET AUTHORED" | **Fixed** — retargeted as build records; convention stated in `modules/MODULES.md` so it is inherited, not re-discovered |
| `MODULES.md` titles drifting from the spine | **Fixed** — M0, M1, M2, M3, M8 restored to spine titles; nicknames live in each `_overview.md` |
