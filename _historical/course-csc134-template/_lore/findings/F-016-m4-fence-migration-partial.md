# F-016 — Paying the half of #30 that was not bookkeeping

**Date:** 2026-07-29 · **Status:** Recorded · **Branch:** `phase0/m4-fence-migration-partial`
**Acts on:** #30 · **Convention:** [[ADR-015-markdown-blocks-mirror-gated-source]] ·
**Context:** [[F-013-markdown-blocks-are-unversioned-copies]], [[F-014-breadth-pass-state-audit]],
[[ADR-016-breadth-first-pass]]

## Why now, and why only half

ADR-016 deferred #30 behind the breadth pass. That was right for one PR at a time. It
stopped being right at two: PR #35 and PR #36 both carried a red `markdown blocks`
job, and the fan-out would have taken it to four or more. **A red job that every PR
carries is a red job nobody reads** — which is the failure the workflow's own comments
warn about, and it would have arrived exactly when born-compliant most needed a signal
that means something.

So: pay the part that is not bookkeeping, defer the part that is.

## 1. The defect — student-facing C++ no gate had ever built

`modules/m4/practice-exit-ticket.md:60`, Item 1.5's "Bridge" program, was a **complete
C++ program with no `.cpp` twin anywhere.** `modules/m4/code/` held
`practice-item1-vault.cpp` for Item 1 and nothing for Item 1.5. It sat inside a module
**certified Ready** (F-006), in a completion-gated beat students must pass.

The answer key had already noticed and left a note:

> *"Item 1.5 bridge snippet is inline (not yet a code/ file)… compiled clean with zero
> warnings under -Wall -Wextra when this beat was updated. If it graduates to code/, add
> `practice-item1_5-mana.cpp` and fold it into the canonical run."*

That note is the finding in miniature. The claim was **true and unverifiable** — someone
did compile it once, by hand, and nothing carried that forward. It is the same shape as
F-009 (a compiler claim that stopped holding) and F-014 §5 (a status banner that stopped
matching): *a fact checked once, then trusted forever.*

**Fixed:** authored as `modules/m4/code/practice-item1_5-mana.cpp` — **the filename the
key itself proposed**, so the note comes true rather than needing a correction. Gated:
clean, zero warnings. Run: prints `You cast a minor spell.`, matching the key's answer B
and its filled trace table. The listing now mirrors it via `excerpt=`, and the key's note
and canonical-run list are updated to match.

## 2. Bucket sizing — F-013's estimate was close but not right

F-013 put six listings in the "already match on code, just drop the header" bucket. Measured
by matching every M4 block against every gated source programmatically, the real split is:

| Shape | Count | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Exact contiguous match already | **4** | Add `excerpt=`, nothing else |
| Match except a **compressed header comment** | **2** | `learn.md` had squashed a 3-line file header to one line |
| Match except **de-indentation** | **1** | The page stripped the 4 spaces the fragment has inside `main` |
| No `.cpp` at all | **1** | §1 above |

So **eight**, not six, and three of them needed more than adding an annotation. The
estimate was not wrong about difficulty — every one of these was minutes, not hours — but
"already match" was doing more work in that sentence than it could carry. **Worth knowing
before someone schedules the rest of #30 off F-013's numbers.**

**On the two compressed headers.** `learn.md` labelled its staged builds inside the code
block — `// learn-gate-strength.cpp — Stage A` — where the file carries a fuller three-line
header. The cheap fix is to drop the line, but the Stage A/B label is load-bearing: CLAUDE.md
bar #9 makes staged builds a requirement, and the label is how a reader sees the stages. So
the label was **lifted into the prose above the fence** instead — a bold *Stage A* followed
by the filename in a code span, on its own line directly above the listing. The information
survives, the listing becomes a clean excerpt, and the page arguably reads better: the label
is now visible before the code rather than buried in its first line.

**On the de-indented fragment.** Item 7's chain was shown flush-left; in
`practice-item7-status.cpp` it lives inside `main` with four spaces. Re-indenting the
listing to match is the whole fix. Nothing is lost — the fragment is *more* honest indented,
because that is where it actually lives.

## 3. The countdown

| | Unmigrated | Matched |
|---|---|---|
| Before | 45 | 0 |
| After | **37** | **8** |

**`modules/m4/practice-exit-ticket.md` is fully migrated** — it has left the countdown
entirely, the first file in the repo to do so.

Compile gate: 33 files, 32 clean, 1 expected (marked). Markdown gate self-tests still pass
in both directions — the gate can still go red.

## What is deliberately left

**37 blocks**, and the shape of the remaining work is genuinely different from what was
paid here:

- `apply-tutorial.md` × 2 modules, 16 blocks — **the staged builds.** These are *shorter
  whole programs*, not slices of the finished file, so each stage needs its own gated
  `.cpp` (`apply-gatekeeper-stage1.cpp`, `-stage2.cpp`, …). This is the bulk of #30 and the
  only part that is real authoring rather than annotation. It also converts bar #9 from an
  assertion into a checked fact, which is worth doing properly rather than quickly.
- `learn.md` × 2 modules, 12 blocks — fragments and the deliberately-broken one-liners,
  which need `EXPECT-WARNING`/`EXPECT-ERROR` files behind them.
- `assess-lab.md` × 2, 2 blocks.
- `m5/practice-exit-ticket.md`, 7 blocks — likely the same easy shapes as M4's were; M5 was
  never measured the way M4 was here.

**The gate stays red.** That is correct and unchanged: the remaining 37 are still
unverifiable, and red is what unverifiable should look like.

---

## Closed: #30 is paid in full (2026-07-31)

**71 blocks, 71 matched, 0 unmigrated. The markdown gate is green** — the first time since
it shipped. It went 45 → 37 (#37) → 18 (#44) → **0**, and it is now a regression test
rather than a countdown: a new un-annotated block fails it on arrival.

### The remaining work was mis-sized here, in both directions

The section above predicted the 37 as "16 staged builds + 12 learn.md fragments + 2
assess-lab + 7 exit-ticket, likely easy." Measured against the actual `.cpp` files, the
split was different:

| Predicted | Actual |
|---|---|
| `m5/practice-exit-ticket.md` "likely the same easy shapes" | **Correct** — 6 exact excerpts, 1 near-miss. Whole file migrated in minutes. |
| `learn.md` × 2 = 12 blocks of broken one-liners | **Half wrong.** M5's six were whole programs with trimmed headers (elision, minutes). M4's six had **no gated file anywhere** and needed five new sources. |
| 16 staged builds, "the bulk of #30" | **Wrong by half.** Only **7** were true stages needing new files; the other 9 were exact excerpts of sources that already existed, or one-liners. |

**Both errors came from estimating by file name instead of by content.** `apply-tutorial.md`
was assumed to be all staged builds because that is what an Apply beat mostly is; it also
contained four break-it exercises and four already-matching excerpts. The lesson from
F-013 and from this file's own top section keeps re-proving itself: **measure the blocks,
do not count the files.**

### Bar #9 is now a checked fact

Seven staged-build programs exist that never did — four for M4's gatekeeper, three for
M5's level-up table. Every one compiles clean under the course flags **and was run** to
confirm behaviour actually accumulates:

- M4 stage 3 → stage 4: a Rogue with a lockpick takes a branch stage 3 did not have.
- M5 stage 1 → 2 → 3: banner, then headers, then ten rows.

The compile gate can prove a stage builds. It cannot prove a stage *runs*, or that stage
N+1 does more than stage N — those were checked by hand and are worth re-checking by hand
whenever a stage is edited.

**`// NEW` markers live in the `.cpp` files.** The tutorials mark each stage's additions
with a trailing `// NEW`, and ADR-015 requires exact text, so the markers had to go
somewhere. Putting them in the source is the right call twice over: bar #9 already says
*"mark the stages in comments,"* and a stage file whose markers disagreed with the printed
listing would be the exact defect this gate exists to catch. The invariant the files hold:
**at stage N, only stage N's lines carry `// NEW`.**

### Two files broken on purpose that no compiler will ever complain about

`apply-break-swapped.cpp` (M4) and `apply-break-and-validation.cpp` (M5) are the first
deliberately-wrong files in the repo that are **NOT** marked `EXPECT-WARNING` — because
there is nothing to warn about. Both compile perfectly clean under `-Wall -Wextra`:

- `&&` where `||` belongs: the condition is never true, so the validation loop never runs.
- An if/else-if ladder with the branches out of order: a strength-90 hero is told they are
  "borderline", verified by running it.

They needed a header explaining *why the absence of a marker is itself the assertion*,
because a future reader finding an unmarked broken file will reasonably assume someone
forgot the marker. **A clean-compiling wrong program is the sharpest available teaching
example of the fourth error word**, and the gate now holds both of them in place.

### Stale-claim sweep

Closing the debt made two status claims false, both fixed here:

- `.github/workflows/compile-gate.yml` — the job comment read *"EXPECTED RED until M4's 23
  blocks are migrated."*
- `ADR-015 §6` — *"the gate ships enforcing, and `main` goes red."* The decision text
  stands as the record of why; a status note now says the state it describes is over.

This is the **fifth shape of stale claim** in the ledger, and the first that lives in
**CI configuration** rather than in prose: a comment on a job that tells the next reader
to expect a failure that can no longer happen. Grep for status claims does not reach into
`.github/` unless someone thinks to look there.

### Review round — a false behavioural claim, in a comment, on correct code

Copilot caught three on #45, all real, all mine:

**`apply-break-and-validation.cpp` said *"Type `banana` and it spins forever."* It does not.**
Run it and the whole program is:

```
Choose (1-3): You chose 0.
```

The read fails, `choice` stays 0, the dead guard is skipped, and it exits. **There is no
outer loop for it to spin in** — the spinning belongs to the *student's* menu, where the
same guard sits inside a `do/while` and the uncleared fail state makes every later read
fail too. I had described the symptom from the tutorial's context and attached it to a
minimal reproducer that cannot produce it.

**This is F-009's exact shape** — *false claims in comments sitting on correct code* — and
it is the shape ADR-015 was written to stop. The gate did its job perfectly and could not
help: the fence matches the source byte-for-byte, and the source's own header is the thing
that lies. **Provenance verifies that the page and the program agree. Nothing verifies
that either one is telling the truth about what the program does.**

Prompted by the catch, every broken-on-purpose file in M4 and M5 was compiled **and run**,
and its header checked line by line against actual output. The other six were accurate. But
they were accurate by luck of attention, not by any gate, and the same is true of every
"Program Output:" block in every reading.

**Rule, and it is the third time this pass has landed on some version of it:** a comment
that describes runtime behaviour is a claim, and a claim gets *run*, not reasoned about.
The two smaller catches were the same family — a PR count stated as "four" when the history
shows three, and a header describing Break A as changing `==` to `=` when the tutorial
changes `>=` to `=`. Cheap to state, cheap to check, never checked by a machine.
